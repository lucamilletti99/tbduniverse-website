Backend: Wrote Rest endpoints to create elements in database for post and to get a chuck norris joke from external api when get route is accessed. 
Jefs Unit Test was unable to test his own unit test since he had no access to unix to run mocha.
Frontend: Created a yes/no vue component and on yes click the get route is fetched and returns a JSON containing a chucknorris joke. The joke is then rendered on the page
